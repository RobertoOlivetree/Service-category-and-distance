# Spatial Analysis of Service Accessibility  

This repository contains a set of scripts and data files for analyzing **the average distance to services** and **the distribution of service categories** in selected parishes. The project leverages **Python, GeoPandas, Folium, and OSMnx** to perform spatial analysis and visualization.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to:  
- **Analyze building accessibility** to nearby services.  
- **Compute average distances** from buildings to services using a street network.  
- **Visualize service distribution** across different categories.  
- **Generate interactive maps** with Folium for better insights.
